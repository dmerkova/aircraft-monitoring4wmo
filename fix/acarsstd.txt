Pressure Categories (hPa)   
LOW:   PRES >  700.0
MID:   PRES <= 700.0 and PRES >= 300.0
HIGH:  PRES <  300.0

ID: aircraft tail number    
NA: number of temperature or wind reports available in the pressure category
NT: number of temperature or wind reports in the pressure category after thinning
NR: number of temperature or wind reports rejected in the pressure category
NG: number of observations with gross errors (large difference to Guess)
NC: number of zero-speed (calm) wind reports
TB: temperature bias (OB - Guess) in deg. C for non-gross-error temperature data
TSTD: standard deviation of temperature difference of (OB - Guess) 
SB:   speed bias (OB - Guess) in m/s for non-gross-error wind data 
WRMS: RMS difference of (OB - Guess) for non-gross-error wind data 

Criterion for excess gross difference to Guess: 
 Temperature: LOW 15.0; MID 10.0; HIGH 10.0  (deg. C)
 Wind:        LOW 15.0; MID 15.0; HIGH 20.0  (m/s) 

Minimum Counts needed for suspect criterion:
              LOW 20; MID 50; HIGH 50 

Suspect Criteria
 Temperature Bias: LOW  3.0; MID 2.0; HIGH  2.0 (deg. C)
 Temperature  RMS: LOW  4.0; MID 3.0; HIGH  3.0 (deg. C)
 Wind Speed  Bias: LOW  3.0; MID 2.5; HIGH  2.5 (m/s)
 Wind         RMS: LOW 10.0; MID 8.0; HIGH 10.0 (m/s)
 More than 2% of observations have gross errors
